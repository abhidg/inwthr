# Indian weather data command-line tool

This small program was directly inspired by
http://fungi.yuggoth.org/weather/ which shows a nice summary of the
weather from METAR data.

However METAR data is collected only at airports; while I found that IMD
Kolkata has a wonderful page [1] using Google maps which shows the weather
data from the numerous installed automatic weather stations. Plus, the cool
bit is that they have an export function which dumps all that data into CSV
file for easy parsing.

So I put together this script to parse the file (which stores the weather
data in the SYNOP format) and give the weather information on the terminal.
